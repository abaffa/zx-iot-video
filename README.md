# zx-iot-video

This project creates the firmware for **ZX-Wespi-V** - a DIY ESP32-based TFT-video-display and wifi-enabled fileserver for ZX81.
When using a Sinclair ZX81 nowadays, one may look for a more handy replacement of the TV set and cassette recorder. 
Maybe even something that can be built in, and allows to exchange the ZX programs and files via wifi to your modern computer. 

Common modern LCD monitors often get in trouble with the ancient ZX81 video signal, as there is no colour carrier signal that allows the monitor to recognize PAL versus NTSC, and the  synchonisation sinals are - lets say a 'bit more dynamic' than on modern devices, so nowadays' displays are offended and show blue screens whenever ZX switches to FAST mode. Wespi-V is ZX-aware, starts up fast, handles FAST mode gracefully, and shows the expected LOAD/SAVE-stripes.

Components needed for building the device are quite inexpensive (about 20â‚¬ in total), and required soldering skills are just classic cables and a few simple components.

## Hardware

ESP32-based modules are often used whenever it comes down to electronics control tasks, combined with wifi communication abilities. Here,
the I2S interface of the ESP is used to retrieve the ZX81 video signal - which is, as special feature of the ingenious ZX computers, also used as tape recorder output. ESP32 furthermore feeds the tape input of the ZX computer, so LOAD and SAVE work.

![Schematic outline](doc/zx-iot-video-sketch.png "How to connect ZX, ESP32, and TFT Display")


    R1: 1K5 Ohm 
    R2: 180K Ohm
    R3: 4K7 Ohm
    R4: 100 Ohm
    ...


### Power regulator

ESP32 and TFT-diplay need 5 Volts at about 250mA. Safest variant is an additional switching regulator like outlined in the schematic sketch. If your ZX is already upgraded with a modern regulator or bigger heat sink, you may use the 5V from the ZX81 PCB directly.

### When using this device as an external monitor

If you do not want to modify the ZX81 or its case, Wespi-V can also be used as external monitor, connected via
longer cables. In this case, R1 should be a 75 Ohms resistor to act as standard cable impedance termination. Of course, in this case it is required that the ZX is equipped with a video mod/amplifier. 


## Version Info

0.5.0 Initial pre-release (somehow derived from zx-iot-mi)











## Downloading the firmware to the ESP32 Module

Info for the flash files and initial image download for the ZX-Wespi project:

ZX-Wespi is usually able to do over-the-air (OTA) updates via the webserver user interface. 

However, for the following cases a regular download of the flash image is required:

- When initially setting up a brand new ESP32 for your Zeddy
- If something went really wrong during OTA
- If you want to reuse an ESP32 that was used in a different project

This short instruction is for using the ESP32 download tool (tested with V3.8.5)


- Connect ESP32 to computer via USB or COM as applicable

- Get the download tool, at time of writing available at  <https://www.espressif.com/en/support/download/other-tools>, choose flash_download_tool_v3.8.5 or higher
- Run the tool, go to "Developer Mode", "ESP32", choose "SPI download" tab
- Set up the following files and positions to flash:

  partition-table.bin     @  0x8000 
  ota_data_initial.bin    @  0xd000
  bootloader.bin          @  0x1000
  zx_iot.bin		  @ 0x10000

- For the rest of parameters, use:

  SPI SPEED 40MHz
  SPI MODE DIO
  FLSH SIZE 32MBit  (=4MB)
  COM: (need to find out, look up in your OS' device manager in case of doubt)
  BAUD: 460800 (may pick a different baud rate)


- Press start to flash. If the ESP32 does not connect automatically, try holding the BOOT knob and/or EN(reset)
